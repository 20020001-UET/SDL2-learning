**Lesson** | **Contents** | **Check**
-------|----------|-------
**Lesson 01** - Hello SDL | _In this tutorial we will be setting up the SDL library and creating our first window._ | 
**Lesson 02** - Getting an Image on the Screen | _Now that we can get a window to appear, lets blit an image onto it._ | 
**Lesson 03** - Event Driven Programming | _Here we'll start handling user input by allowing the user to X out the window._ |
**Lesson 04** - Key Presses | _Here we'll learn to handle keyboard input._ |
**Lesson 05** - Optimized Surface Loading and Soft Stretching | _Now that we know how to load and blit surfaces, it's time to make our blits faster. We'll also take a smaller image and stretch it to fit the screen._ |
**Lesson 06** - Extension Libraries and Loading Other Image Formats | _Here we'll be using the SDL_image extension library to load png images._ |
**Lesson 07** - Texture Loading and Rendering | _A big new feature in SDL 2.0 is hardware accelerated texture based 2D rendering. Here we'll be loading an image to render it using textures._ |
**Lesson 08** - Geometry Rendering | _Another new feature in SDL 2.0 is hardware accelerated primitive rendering. Here we'll be using it to render some common shapes._ |
**Lesson 09** - The Viewport | _SDL 2.0 also lets you control where you render on the screen using the viewport. We'll be using the viewport to create subscreens._ |
**Lesson 10** - Color Keying | _Here we'll use color keying to give textures transparent backgrounds._ |
